## My Website 

### Purpose
To create a website using HTML, CSS/SCSS and any other skills and techniques learnt on the Coder Academy course. Using what we had learned, we had to create a multi page website to promote ourselves to future perspective employees. 
### Functionality/Features
The website has to responsive so it can load on any device from a mobile phone to a tablet and up to a desktop machine. It also had to fair well in a Google audit on all pages. We also had to implement subresource integrity on any CSS files used.
To attain this I used Flexbox and media queries so it worked on all devices and  implemented alternate text on images. These all helped towards getting good audit results when I done the Google audit. I also got a hash for each of my CSS files for added security.
### Sitemap
I created a website with a main page, and three other pages coming off of that. I also created four sub pages for the blogs as we had to do five articles, illustrated below.
