               Hi, I am currently training to be a full stack developer at The Coder Academy in Brisbane. 
               Previously I was battling the photocopier breakdown epidemic that has hit all offices. I'm sorry to 
               say the machines won. During many battles I did enjoy making them work in different environments; and the fault finding
               and problem solving. Traits I hope to continue to use as a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2009 my wife and I decided to go travelling round Australia for a few months. Ten years, three kids and a mortgage later,
                we are still here loving the lifestyle Australia has to offer. When I am not coding, you can usually find me hanging with the family,
                or visiting places we havent been before. Please click on the link below to see my current Resume.
